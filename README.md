1. click on the project name of the person we want to contribute to, then on the top right corner of the page clcik on 
"Fork" icon
2. After fork is generated click 'Code' button in a blue color and copy Https
   e.g:- https://github.com/Username/abebe.git
3. on the terminal/command prompt write:-
  e.g:- git clone https://github.com/Username/abebe.git
4. Navigate to your local repository
 e.g:- cd cd abebe ----which is downloaded
5. Check that your fork is the "origin" remote
 e.g:- git remote -v 
If you don't see an "origin" remote, you can add it using: 
git remote add origin https://github.com/Username/abebe.git
6. Add the project repository as the "upstream" remote
 e.g:- git remote add upstream https://github.com/Username/abebe.git
  //check it as:- git remote -v
7. Pull the latest changes from upstream into your local repository
Before you start making any changes to your local files, it's a good practice to first synchronize your local repository with the project repository. Use "git pull upstream master" to "pull" any changes from the "master" branch of the "upstream" into your local repository. (If the project repository uses "main" instead of "master" for its default branch, then you would use "git pull upstream main" instead.)
8. CHeck existed branchs 
 eg:- git checkout
 e.g:git checkout -b edeme //to create new branch
9. Make changes in your local repository you downloaded as fork
10. Add your changes
    e.g:- git add . //to add whole current folder
          git add filename //to add single files
11. Step 10: Commit your changes
    e.g:- git commit -m "DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES" 
12. Step 11: Push your changes to your fork
    e.g:- git push origin BRANCH_NAME
13. Step 12: Begin the pull request
14. Review the pull request

----------------------Done-------------
